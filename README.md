Popular - The Advanced View Counter for ExpressionEngine

Popular is an Add-On for ExpressionEngine that enhances view counting.  Popular tracks views over time and can also track the location and user agent of the viewing device.  As a result, you can output popular entries in a number of new and interesting ways.  Want to show the user trending articles on their device? Done.  Popular articles this week in their city... you got it.  Want to compare the entries that are doing best on Mobile vs. Tablet vs. Desktop?  Vini Vidi Vici.  

Popular is a work in progress.  If there's a feature that you'd like to see that we haven't thought of, drop us a line.  We'll do our best to make it happen.
